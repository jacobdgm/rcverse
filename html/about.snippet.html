    <p>
      RCVerse is a tool for all Recursers, in-batch and alum, remote and in-hub.
    </p>

    <p>
      We want to connect. We want tools to help connect us. We know how to build
      them. Let's build them!
    </p>

    <p>
      The lofty, long term goal of RCVerse is to be open source, to be a
      website, to be a canvas for the creativity of RCers, to be a practice
      ground for creative web development, to be a space for trying out novel
      collaborative tools.
    </p>

    <p>
      The more practical short-term goal for this site is to be the first place
      RCers look when they sign on in the morning, to see what's going on, both
      virtually and physically. To do this, we'll have to keep making it more
      useful over time, and removing any friction which keeps it being as useful
      as it can be.
    </p>

    <summary>Usage</summary>

    <p>
      To view this page without any customizations active, add the query
      parameter <code>?basic</code> or <a href="/?basic">click here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Normally, the rooms on the page are sorted in order of most participants
      to least. To disable sorting and use a roughly alphebetical, stable room
      order, add the query parameter <code>?sort=none</code> or
      <a href="/?sort=none">click here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To combine URL parameters, combine them in any order with a
      <code>&</code> (ampersand) between them, and only one
      <code>?</code> (question mark) at the start. E.g.
      <code>?basic&sort=none</code>

    <summary>âš  XSS vulnerability</summary>

    <p>
      There's a new section named "Custom Code" at the bottom of the page. All
      room notes are now properly HTML escaped.
    </p>

    <p>
      This site has a XSS vulnerability. That means you can inject code which
      will be run when other people load the page in their browser. Don't know
      what that means? See if you can figure it out. Google's your friend. Ask
      other recursers. Poke around.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can inject CSS with a <code>style</code> tag or JavaScript with a
      <code>script</code> tag.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please be kind. Do not use blocking JS (like <code>alert</code>) or CSS
      which makes the page (totally) unreadable. If you're writing a loop, maybe
      test that out on a test HTML page first so that you don't crash this page
      for others.
    </p>

      Currently

        custom code is ephemeral</a
      >. Changes are likely to disappear any time. So if you make a change you
      like, take a screenshot and post your code in the zulip thread! Later, you
      or someone else can reapply the change.
